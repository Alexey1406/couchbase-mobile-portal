  summary: Purge document
  description: |
    When an applicaiton deletes a document a tombstone revison is created, over time the number tombstones can become significant. Tombstones allow document deletions to be propogated to other clients via replication. For some applications the replication of a tombstone may not be useful after period of time. The purge command provides a way to remove the tombstones from a Sync Gateway database, recovering storage space and reducing the amount of data replicated to clients.
