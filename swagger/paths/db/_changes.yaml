  summary: Changes
  description: |
    This request retrieves a sorted list of changes made to documents in the database, in time order of application. Each document appears at most once, ordered by its most recent change, regardless of how many times it's been changed.
    This request can be used to listen for update and modifications to the database for post processing or synchronization. A continuously connected changes feed is a reasonable approach for generating a real-time log for most applications.
