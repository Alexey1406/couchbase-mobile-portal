   <introduction>
      <paragraph>A Couchbase Lite <strong>database</strong> is a collection of documents, and serves as a namespace to look them up by their unique document IDs. The database supports the typical <external-ref href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</external-ref> operations (create, read, update, and delete) .</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Unlike relational databases, Couchbase Lite databases don't contain tables. They're not necessaryâ€”tables exist to define a schema for their rows, and Couchbase Lite documents don't have a schema. You can freely put different types of documents, containing different properties appropriate to their types, into the same database. It is very convenient, though, to be able to easily distinguish different types of documents (especially in <ref href="#views-and-queries">view functions</ref>), so there's an informal convention of using a <code>type</code> property whose value is a string identifying the document type.</paragraph>
