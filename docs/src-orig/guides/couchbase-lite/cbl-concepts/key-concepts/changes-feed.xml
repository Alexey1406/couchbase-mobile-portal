   <introduction>
      <paragraph>Couchbase Lite provides a mechanism called the <emphasis>changes feed</emphasis> to track changes to a database. Couchbase Lite assigns a sequence identifier, similar to a serial number, to each document update. The database's changes feed is a query that returns metadata about all document updates that have occurred since a given sequence identifier. The client can then store the latest sequence identifier reported in the feed, and the next time it fetches the feed it passes in that sequence identifier so it can get only the new changes. Couchbase Lite also provides a mechanism to leave the feed running and be notified of all new changes in real time.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The changes feed powers sync between devices or from the Sync Gateway to a device. It can also be used by asynchronous background processes to be notified of updates by Sync Gateway. For instance, to send an email when a user creates a new document, you could have a script listen to the changes feed from Sync Gateway and send emails when it sees a relevant document.</paragraph>
