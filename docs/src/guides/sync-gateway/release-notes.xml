            <introduction>
                <paragraph>
                    In our latest patch release, 1.0.2, we've tackled usability issues that have surfaced since 1.0.0, in particular
                    taking a look at a replication loops that arose from manually adding new users to a channel, 
                    enhancing our shadow bucket feature with protected buckets, handling bad behavior scenarios like extremely
                    short passwords, performance issues around <code>_all_docs</code>, and added support to handle in-production changes of the
                    sync function without forcing downtime of the Sync Gateway node. These fixes and more are detailed in our highlights list below:

            <description>1.0.1 Release Notes for Sync Gateway</description>
            <introduction>
                <paragraph>
                    This is our first patch for our 1.0.0 release from May. 
                    Issues addressed center on improving the Sync Gateway's performance, bumping up the current limitation on the Attachment size, and
                    continued development of our experimental admin tooling centered on Sync Function development.

            <description>1.0.0 Release Notes for Sync Gateway</description>
            <introduction>
                <paragraph>
                    This is our first production-ready release of Sync Gateway. A major change between our last Beta and our 1.0.0
                    release was major performance tweaks to optimize the flow of data between client to Sync Gateway, and building 
                    an understanding of best practices and sizing for deployment with common use case models. You can learn our findings
                    in the Deployment guide that addresses this very topic.

                    Another addition was the availability of the Windows installer. A popular request, we finally added this package for our
                    1.0.0 release. We now have support the same platforms as Couchbase Server, including: Red Hat, Ubuntu, Mac and
                    Windows.
