   <introduction>
      <paragraph>In general, <external-ref href="http://curl.haxx.se"/>, a command-line HTTP client, is your friend. You might also want to try <external-ref href="https://github.com/jkbr/httpie"/>, a human-friendly command-line HTTP client. By using these tools, you can inspect databases and documents via the Sync REST API, and look at user and role access privileges via the Admin REST API.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>An additional useful tool is the admin-port URL /<emphasis>databasename</emphasis>/_dump/channels, which returns an HTML table that lists all active channels and the documents assigned to them. Similarly, "/<emphasis>databasename</emphasis>/_dump/access" shows which documents are granting access to which users and channels.</paragraph>
