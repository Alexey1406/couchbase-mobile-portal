   <title>Scaling Sync Gateway</title>
   <description>TODO: Add description.</description>
   <introduction>
      <paragraph>Sync Gateway can be scaled up by running it as a cluster. This means running an identically configured instance of Sync Gateway on each of several machines, and load-balancing them by directing each incoming HTTP request to a random node. Sync Gateway nodes are "shared-nothing," so they don't need to coordinate any state or even know about each other. Everything they know is contained in the central Couchbase Server bucket.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>All Sync Gateway nodes talk to the same Couchbase Server bucket. This can, of course, be hosted by a cluster of Couchbase Server nodes. Sync Gateway uses the standard Couchbase "smart-client" APIs and works with database clusters of any size.</paragraph>
