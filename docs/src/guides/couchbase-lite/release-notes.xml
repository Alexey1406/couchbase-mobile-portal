                            This is our first official release for Couchbase Lite. A major change from our Beta releases and 1.0.0
                            is an expansion of our platform support, which includes a 1.0.0 ready version of "portable" Java libraries
                            to support Linux-based app development. We've also made a lot of advancement in the performance stability of
                            our Android and Java platform, created better parity for our authentication support, and enabled better
                            logging for community debugging feedback. Simultaneously to this release, we have also published our first
                            beta for our C# support in a collaborative effort with our partner, Xamarin.

                            As we continue to build out our platform, we have made some API naming changes to reflect a strengthened spec that
                            supports us across many different spaces. Between our last Beta and 1.0.0, we've made some minor adjustments to 
                            our naming conventions regarding basic authentication, cookie-based authentication, and logging support.

                            enhancements and features, we've gone over and done a number of major improvements on our built-in test infrastructure including using
                            a mockwebserver that better simulates "un"-happy network paths.

                            to support Linux-based app development. We've also made a lot of advancement in the performance stability of
                            our Android and Java platform, created better parity for our authentication support, and enabled better
                            logging for community debugging feedback. Simultaneously to this release, we have also published our first
                            beta for our C# support in a collaborative effort with our partner, Xamarin.

                            Java shares a core set of libraries with our Android platform, and faces a similar set of known issues regarding performance that we are actively addressing.
                            In particular, we are resolving replication issues with high bulk volumes of data between Java client and Server that show
                            minute memory leaks.

                            We are also expanding our built library package offering. Today we offer 32-bit and 64-bit Linux support, suitable
                            for building apps on platforms such as the Raspberry Pi. We are also looking into packaging for other desktop platforms 
                            and will be releasing them soon.

                        <paragraph>In our first Beta release of C# support, we have a majority of features ported over from our Java libraries, but still have a remaining amount of
                            work and progress to make, specifically in Replication. We also still need to develop a working and distributable PCL for full .NET support, but in the meantime you can
                            make use of the Xamarin binding for C# for iOS and Android.</paragraph>
