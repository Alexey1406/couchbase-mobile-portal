         <title>Does replication create an always-open socket to the server?</title>
         <body>
            <paragraph>It depends on how you configure the replication. You can set up a continuous replication that is always active when the device is online, or you can trigger a one-shot replication whenever you want.</paragraph>

         <title>Can the traffic be compressed?</title>
         <body>
            <paragraph>Yes, by using regular HTTP gzip transfer encoding. A proxy like nginx or Apache can apply this encoding transparently.</paragraph>

         <title>Does replication transfer the whole changed document or just an update that contains only the changes?</title>
         <body>
            <paragraph>It sends the whole document. Typically documents aren't that big. If a document contains attachments, only the ones that have changed are transferred.</paragraph>

         <body>
            <paragraph>If the client has an active replication, changes from the server are pushed to it within a second or two. On iOS 7, your server can send push notifications that invisibly wake up the app and let it replicate the new changes.</paragraph>
