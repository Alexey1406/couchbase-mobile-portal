   <title>Documents</title>
   <description>TODO: Add description.</description>
   <introduction>
      <paragraph>A document is a JSON object, similar to a dictionary data structure, that consists of arbitrary key-value pairs. There’s no schema—every document can have its own individual set of keys, although almost all databases adopt one or more informal schemas.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>A document has a much more flexible data format than a SQL database row, generally contains all the information about a data entity (including compound data) rather than being normalized across tables, and can have arbitrary-sized binary attachments.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Whatever its contents, though, every document has a special property called <code>_id</code>. This property is the <strong>document ID</strong>, which is the document's unique identifier in its database. A document ID is similar to a SQL primary key, except that primary keys are usually integers while document IDs are strings.  When you create a document, you can either provide your own ID or let Couchbase Lite assign one. If you provide your own document IDs, you can use any string you want, such as a <external-ref href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuid">universally unique identifier</external-ref> (UUID) or a string that is meaningful to your application.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Documents have some other special properties, and their names always start with an underscore. The leading underscore denotes a reserved property—don't use an underscore prefix for any of your own properties.</paragraph>
