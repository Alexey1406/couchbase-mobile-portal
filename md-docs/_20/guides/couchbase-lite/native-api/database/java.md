âš  Support in the current Developer Build is for Android only. The SDK cannot be used in Java applications.

## New Database

As the top-level entity in the API, new databases can be created using the `Database` class by passing in a name, configuration, or both. The following example creates a database using the `Database(name: String)` method.

```java
DatabaseConfiguration config = new DatabaseConfiguration(/* Android Context*/ context);
Database database = new Database("my-database", config);
```

Just as before, the database will be created in a default location. Alternatively, the `Database(name: Strings, config: DatabaseConfiguration?)` method can be used to provide specific options (the directory to create the database in, whether it is read-only etc.)

## Migrating from 1.x Databases

Databases that were created with Couchbase Mobile 1.2 or later can be read using the 2.0 API. Upon detecting it is a 1.x database file format, Couchbase Lite will automatically upgrade it to the new format used in 2.0. This feature is currently only available for the default storage type, SQLite (i.e not for ForestDB databases).

##  Encryption

The following example demonstrates how to create a database with an encryption key (or open an existing one).

[//]: # (TODO: replace below with ObjC/C#/Java)

```swift
var dbConfig = DatabaseConfiguration()
dbConfig.encryptionKey = EncryptionKey.password("secretpassword")
self.database = try Database(name: "my-database", config: dbConfig)
```

## Singleton Pattern

The database instance must be used throughout the Couchbase Lite API to Create, Update, Delete and Query documents. Hence, the singleton pattern is useful to create a single instance of the `Database` object. The following example follows the Singleton Pattern in `Swift`.

[//]: # (TODO: replace below with ObjC/C#/Java)

```swift
class DataManager {
  static let sharedInstance: DataManager = DataManager()
	
  private init() {
    do {
  	  self.database = try Database(name: "dbname")
    } catch {
  	  fatalError("Could not initialize database")
    }
  }
}
```

The database instance can then be access throughout the codebase using the class property: `DataManager.sharedInstance.database`.
